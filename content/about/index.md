Hi, I'm Pietro.

I'm a software engineer from Milan, Italy.

My passions:
- üìö Reading ([GoodReads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50617122-pietro-de-nicolao))
- üíª Programming ([GitHub profile](https://github.com/pietrodn))
- üè¶ Personal finance, cryptocurrency investing

I currently work for [Bending Spoons](https://bendingspoons.com).

## Open knowledge

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Wikimedia_logo_family_complete-2013.svg" alt="Wikimedia Foundation project logos" width="400" align="center" >}}

I recognize the immense contribution that open, free knowledge has given to the world.

In the past I've been an active Wikipedia contributor under the username of [Pietrodn](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utente:Pietrodn); from 2006 to 2009, I've been an administrator of the Italian Wikipedia.

I developed three tools to help Wikimedians work more efficiently on their projects:
* [Section Links](https://section-links.toolforge.org/) analyzes all the links incoming from or arriving to a specific page and shows those pointing to non-existing sections.
* [Intersect Contribs](https://intersect-contribs.toolforge.org/) intersects the contribution history of two users on a Wikimedia project to find which pages have been edited by both of them.  It's useful to discover sockpuppets, double votes and false accounts.
* [itwikinews-rss](https://github.com/pietrodn/itwikinews-rss) is a tool that automatically generates a RSS feed for the Italian version of Wikinews, Wikinotizie.

I'm a member of [Wikimedia Italia](https://www.wikimedia.it/), the Italian branch of the Wikimedia Foundation.
Please consider giving your [5x1000](https://cinquepermille.wikimedia.it/), or [donating](https://sostieni.wikimedia.it/), to Wikimedia Italia.
